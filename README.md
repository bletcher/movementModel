Movement models for PIT tagged fish in streams

Steps: get and prepare raw data, viz raw data, iterate to get antenna data correct (in WB), develop model for river transitions including captures, antenna data, wanding data, and acoustic tag data. Start with SB then do WB. After river-based model, do a section-within-river model. This will add habitat and density covariates. Finally feed the movement model output into the growth model, then feed growth model results into survival model.
